	<h1 class='title'>||Welcome to the Chinese ethnic group research and essay project||</h1>
	<h2>Let's study!</h2>
	<h1 class='title'>This is your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdVFIFnDcrU">PREREQUISITE</a></h1>
	<h1 class='title'>Then go <a href="https://forms.gle/UGGp9J1V1Dz9GMQh6">here</a>. ONLY ANSWER QUESTION 1</h1>
	<h1 class='title'>Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China">here</a> to find an ethnic group of China you want to study!</h1>
	<h1 class='title'>First search up an article in google about the ethnic group you want to study in wikipedia from the link I posted above. Then, click command + f if on mac, and control + f if you are on chromebook or PC and search in the ethnic group in that bar. Then, collect that evidence and annotate in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hHqYR7brXBtsKsME6KvM_Gk4mTGdW7va8XTq5I0ISNA/edit#slide=id.g895d9042d7_0_0b">this google slide</a> in my formatting and be sure to add a picture from the article you read.</h1>
	<h1 class='title'>Then, go back into the google form, and then go organize your notes in your annotation into an essay. When you finish that do the bibliography as the next question and submit the quiz! Remember to use noodletools! If you forget, listen to Ms. Summa's screencastify video of how to make a bibliography!</h1>
