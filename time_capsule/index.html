	<h1 class='title'>Welcome to my first digital Time Capsule project</h1>
	<h1 class='title'>I will be telling what is going on every day.</h1>
	<h1 class='title'>5/20/20</h1>
	<h2>I fear that some person from Bigelow Middle School might have caught corona. This is because we have like millions of cases of Corona in the US. What I do is finish my work each week. What I do every day is my math homework each day because I do my homework on understanding statistics. This is my last unit of the year given by Ms. Arcangeli, my math teacher. I daydream about my fears about corona that is contemporary like currently coronavirus in Massachusetts is in the 18,000s. I take deep breaths to take my mind off my fears.</h2>

	<h2>I use zoom to stay connected when I am talking to teachers. I like talking to teachers. Ms. Summa is one of my favorite teachers to talk to. Whenever I talk to teachers, I think first. I wish there was a lot more time to stay connected. Sometimes teachers could disable the chat if people are using it for inappropriate reasons or spamming. Zoom is better than Skype in my opinion.</h2>
	<h2>I use Skype also when I am talking with people. Usually it is 1:1, but you can make a group chat and add people to the call. I sometimes don’t talk to other people on Skype. I usually talk on Zoom. I get happier when I talk on Zoom because I have used Skype too much in my life. The coolest thing is that Zoom has a lot more features than Skype. This includes breakout rooms, recording, etc. This is why I like Skype sometimes.</h2>

	<h2>Today is gonna be a cloudy day I realize. It is gonna be warm sometime today. It will be peaceful. I won’t worry about the weather till fall because it will be colder but I can wait.</h2>
	<h2>I am excited to kick off the weekend. It is gonna be in the 70’s but it is fine. I will make a choice. I won’t freeze. It will be warm. I am gonna bike, and do some more fun stuff that day.</h2>
	<h2>Many of my classes are ending today. I get to have a fun day. I am gonna go exercise. I am not gonna lose time on my activities that much. It will be fine. It sucks that I have to do some strict activities that make me sit in one place. I will think of a solution.</h2>
	<h2>This sucks. I need to wait for my school to end which is in like 3 weeks. I am still reading other books such as Tuck Everlasting, The One and Only Ivan, etc. I really like reading. This does not suck that I do not get a fail in my trimester. I can get a pass. I have missed a lot of health classes because it is an uncommon period for 6th graders.</h2>
	<h1 class='title'>5/31/20</h1>
	<h2>Today was in the 70s. It was somewhat good. I spent some time outside. I am still catching up on my work for Tuck Everlasting. I am close to finishing it up though. I will finish it up next week. I will soon be there. What I am worried about is that if I don’t finish the novel by next week. I will wait until it is the day. I am gonna fill out our form.</h2>
	<h2>I had a fun day today. It was warm, it had fresh air, etc. I even finished my english homework. I only need to finish the Tuck Everlasting book. I read towards the beginning. I sure need to fill out the form for my grand jury trial next Tuesday. I will prepare. I will surely prepare ASAP. I have heard of some characters, but I read the rest sometime later because work is hard today.</h2>
	<h1 class='title'>6/1/20</h1>
	<h2>YAY!!! It is finally June!!! We will be having school year end on June 18th, the principals pushed the dates back from June 24th. We had virtual classes that are like 30 mts long. This was really fun. We need to wear masks to go outside still because of the rising cases of Coronavirus in our region. It is gonna be in the 90’s, though. We have summer coming soon. It could be better than spring. In spring it was in the 40’s.</h2>
